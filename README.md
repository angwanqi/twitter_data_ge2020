# Twitter Analysis for GE2020

## 1 Background Information
The 2020 General Elections spans a period from 23 June to 10 July where 10 July is the Polling Day. As such, I thought that it would be interesting to do an analysis using Twitter data to get a sense of the public's sentiment towards this. The analysis is separated into 2 parts. The first part consists of a follower count analysis for each political party that had a Twitter account. Through this, we aim to sieve out some interesting trends that can deepen our understanding of the public's mind. The second part is a sentiment analysis on the general GE2020 and how positive/negative did people on Twitter react to GE2020 and the various 'dramas' that happened.

## 2 Follower Count Analysis
In this analysis, I identified 8 political parties that were contesting in GE2020 and had a Twitter account. The 8 parties are: 

1. Worker's Party (WP)
2. People's Action Party (PAP)
3. Singapore Democratic Party (SDP)
4. National Solidarity Party (NSP)
5. Progress Singapore Party (PSP)
